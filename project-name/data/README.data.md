# Project data

Here is enough raw data that most or all of the data in the paper can be reproduced

## Molecular Parameters

### Molecule-1
**Description**: 
Molecule-1 is a ionic molecule with certain inter and intra molecular interactions.

**Files**
- molecule-1.mcf
- molecule-1.mix

## Conditions

There are the following conditions:
- Condition 1
    + T = 298 K, P = 1 atm, N = 100
    + gas initial condition

At each condtion, simulations were run using BLANK, which can be found in the code section.
`code parameters`

We used the following simulation parameters:
| simulation parameter | value | units
| --- | --- | --- |
| time step | 2 | fs |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

Post processing was done using the following scripts, found in the code section.
